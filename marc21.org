** 006 - Fixed-Length Data Elements - Additional Material Characteristics 
*** Full
*** Concise
    Eighteen character positions (00-17) that provide for coding information about
    special aspects of the item being cataloged that cannot be coded in field 008
    (Fixed-Length Data Elements). It is used in cases when an item has multiple
    characteristics (e.g., printed material with an accompanying cassette or a map
    that is issued serially) and to record the coded serial aspects of nontextual
    continuing resources.
    Field has a generic tree structure, whereby the code given in 006/00 (Form of
    material) determines the data elements defined for subsequent character
    positions. Except for code s (Serial/Integrating resource), the codes in field
    006/00 correspond to those in Leader/06 (Type of record). For each occurrence
    of field 006, the codes defined for character positions 01-17 will be the same
    as those defined in the corresponding field 008, character positions 18-34.
    Configurations of field 006 are given in the following order: books, computer
    files/electronic resources, maps, music, continuing resources, visual
    materials, and mixed materials.

** 007 - Physical Description Fixed Field 
*** Full
*** Concise
      PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION FIXED FIELD--GENERAL INFORMATION (R)
      Special information about the physical characteristics in a coded form. The
      information may represent the whole item or parts of an item such as
      accompanying material.
      The physical characteristics are often related to information in other parts of
      the MARC record especially from field 300 (Physical Description) or one of the
      5XX note fields.
      Field has a generic tree structure, whereby codes given in 007/00 (Category of
      material) determine the data elements defined for subsequent character
      positions.
      The data elements in field 007 are positionally defined and the number of
      character positions in field 007 depends upon the code contained in 007/00.
      Character position 00 contains a code that identifies the category of material.
      The fill character (|) is not allowed in this position. The fill character may
      be used in any other character position when the cataloging agency makes no
      attempt to code the position.
      The categories of material for which field 007 is applicable in bibliographic
      records are presented in the following order in the field description: map,
      electronic resource, globe, tactile material, projected graphic, microform,
      nonprojected graphic, motion picture, kit, notated music, remote-sensing image,
      sound recording, text, videorecording, and unspecified.

** 008 - Fixed-Length Data Elements 
*** Full
*** Concise
      ===============================================================================
      FIXED-LENGTH DATA ELEMENTS--GENERAL INFORMATION (NR)
      Forty character positions (00-39) that provide coded information about the
      record as a whole and about special bibliographic aspects of the item being
      cataloged. These coded data elements are potentially useful for retrieval and
      data management purposes.
      Data elements are positionally-defined. Character positions that are not
      defined contain a blank (#). All defined character positions must contain a
      defined code; for some field 008 positions, this may be the fill character (|).
      The fill character may be used (in certain character positions) when a
      cataloging organization makes no attempt to code the character position. The
      fill character is not allowed in field 008 positions 00-05 (Date entered on
      file). Its use is discouraged in positions 07-10 (Date 1), 15-17 (Place of
      publication, production, or execution), and the 008 position defined for Form
      of item (either position 23 or 29 depending upon the 008 configuration).
      Character positions 00-17 and 35-39 are defined the same across all types of
      material, with special consideration for position 06. The definition of
      character positions 18-34 was done independently for each type of material,
      although certain data elements are defined the same in the specifications for
      more than one type of material. When similar data elements are defined for
      inclusion in field 008 for different types of material, they occupy the same
      field 008 character positions.
      In the following documentation, character positions are described in the order
      of their listing at the beginning of this section. Field 008 positions 00-17
      and 35-39 (All materials) for all types of material are described first,
      followed by seven groups of sections for positions 18-34 (Books, Computer
      files, Maps, Music, Continuing resources, Visual materials and Mixed
      materials).

* 01X-09X: Numbers and Code Fields
** DEFINITION AND SCOPE  
   Fields 01X-09X contain standard numbers, classification numbers, codes, and other data elements relating to the record.
** CONTENT DESIGNATOR HISTORY
   Field 011 - Linking Library of Congress Control Number (BK, MP, MU, VM, SE, USMARC only) [OBSOLETE, 1993]
   Both indicator positions were undefined. A subfield $a (Linking LC control number) was defined. Linking Library of Congress control numbers may be recorded in the 760-787 linking entry fields.

   Field 026 - Fingerprint Identifier [NEW, 2002]

   Field 031 - Musical Incipits Information [NEW, 2004]

   Field 038 - Record Content Licensor [NEW, 2002]

   Field 039 - Level of Bibliographic Control and Coding Detail [OBSOLETE, 1986]
   Field 039 was made obsolete when Leader/17 (Encoding level) code 7 was redefined to identify cataloging that conforms to national minimal level requirements. Field 039 was defined in 1980 to allow an organization to characterize the fullness of various cataloging aspects of records contributed to a national database.

   First indicator position specified the standard against which the data were applied (0 = U.S. national level bibliographic record; 8 = Other); the second indicator was undefined. The subfield codes and the defined codes for each were: $a Level of rules used in bibliographic description (0 = No level defined by rules, 1 = Minimal, 2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $b Level of effort used to assign nonsubject heading access points (2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $c Level of effort used to assign subject headings (0 = None, 2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $d Level of effort used to assign classification (0 = None, 2 = Less than full, 3 = Full); $e Number of fixed field character positions coded (0 = None, 1 = Minimal, 2 = Most necessary, 3 = Full).

   Field 046 - Special Coded Dates [REDEFINED, 2002]
   Field 046 was redefined as a repeatable field.

   Field 047 - Form of musical composition code [REDEFINED, 2006]
   Field 047 was redefined as a repeatable field.

   Field 083 - Additional Dewey Decimal Classification number [NEW, 2008]

   Field 085 - Synthesized classification number components [NEW, 2008] 

   Field 087 - Report Number [OBSOLETE, 1997] [CAN/MARC only]
   Both indicator positions were undefined. The subfield codes were: $a (Report number) and subfield $z (Canceled/invalid report number).

   Field 088 - Document Shelving Number (CODOC) [REDEFINED, 1997] [CAN/MARC only]
   Both indicator positions were undefined. The subfield codes were: $a (Report number) and subfield $z (Canceled/invalid report number).

* 20X-24X: Title and Title-Related Fields
** DEFINITION AND SCOPE
   Title of the item described in the record and variant and former titles that also apply to that item. Field 245 (Title Statement) contains the title as it appears on the chief title source for an item (or substitute for such, formulated according to cataloging guidelines). The uniform title is the primary collecting title for items appearing under multiple titles and the key title is a special unique title for serials. These fields may be used to generate access points and display notes for the various titles, frequently guided by indicator values associated with the fields when entered under a name heading.

** CONTENT DESIGNATOR HISTORY
   Field 211 - Acronym or Shortened Title (CF) [OBSOLETE, 1993]
   Field 211 was made obsolete with the redefinition of field 246       (Varying Form of Title) to include variant titles not found on a piece. The first indicator position specified whether a title added entry should be generated (values 0,1); the second was defined for nonfiling characters (values 0-9). The subfield codes were: $a (Acronym or shortened title), $6 (Linkage).

   Field 212 - Variant Access Title (SE) [OBSOLETE, 1993]
   Field 212 was made obsolete with the redefinition of field 246 (Varying Form of Title) to include variant titles not found on a piece. The first indicator position specified whether a title added entry should be generated (values 0,1); the second was undefined. The subfield codes were: $a (Variant access title), $6 (Linkage).
   
   Field 214 - Augmented Title (BK, CF) [OBSOLETE, 1993]
   Field 214 was made obsolete with the redefinition of field 246 (Varying Form of Title) to include variant titles not found on a piece. The first indicator position specified whether a title added entry should be generated (values 0,1); the second was defined for nonfiling characters (values 0-9). The subfield codes were: $a (Augmented title), $6 (Linkage).
   
   Field 241 - Romanized Title (BK, AM, CF, MP, MU, VM) [OBSOLETE, 1982]
   Field 241 was made obsolete when field 880 (Alternate Graphic Representation) was defined. The field contained the romanized form of a bibliographic title that was transcribed in nonroman characters in a manual catalog record. The first indicator position specified whether a title added entry should be generated (values 0, 1); the second was defined for nonfiling characters (values 0-9). The subfield codes were: $a (Romanized title), $h (Medium).
   
   Field 246 - Varying Form of Title [REDEFINED, 1993]
   Prior to the redefinition of field 246 in 1993 to include all variant titles associated with the item, whether they are or are not on the piece, some variant titles were contained in the following three fields that are now obsolete: 211 (Acronym or Shortened Title), 212 (Variant Access Title), and 214 (Augmented Title).
   
   In 1993, field 246 was also defined for all forms of material. Prior to that date, added entries for variant titles for other than serials and serially-issued computer files were contained in the added entry variant title 740 field which has been redefined as "Added Entry-Uncontrolled Related/Analytical Title."
   
   Field 247 - Former Title [RENAMED, 2002]
   In 2002, the field was renamed from "Former title or title variations" to differentiate it from field 246 (Varying Form of Title)

* 5XX: Note Fields
** DEFINITION AND SCOPE
   Fields 500-59X contain bibliographic notes. Each note is entered as a separate 5XX field. General notes are recorded in field 500 (General Note). Specialized notes are contained in fields 501-586. Prefer a specific note field if there is one when inputting specialized note information in the 5XX notes area. Otherwise, use a 500 General Note.

   Information that appears in the notes area on printed output or machine displays is not always recorded in a specially defined 5XX note field. Data is sometimes carried in a structured or coded form in another field (e.g., field 086 (Government Document Classification Number) or field 310 (Current Publication Frequency)). Some of the fields that contain information that is grouped with 5XX note fields in displays and on printed products are listed below.

   086 - Government Document Classification Number
   246 - Varying Form of Title
   247 - Former Title or Title Variations
   310 - Current Publication Frequency
   321 - Former Publication Frequency
   362 - Dates of Publication and/or Sequential Designation
   76X-78X - Linking Entry Fields

* 6XX: Subject Access Fields
** DEFINITION AND SCOPE
   6XX fields contain subject access entries and terms. Most of these fields contain subject added entries or access terms based on the lists and authority files identified in the second indicator (Subject heading system/thesaurus) or in subfield $2 (Source of subject heading or term). One field contains uncontrolled subject access data.

   For mixed materials and collections under archival control, considerable use is made of the 6XX fields to reflect the subject content of the described materials through controlled and uncontrolled headings and terms. The 7XX fields are used less frequently to provide access.

   Descriptions of the first indicator and all subfield codes, as well as input conventions for the 600, 610, 611, and 630 fields, are given in the following General Information sections: X00, X10, X11 and X30. The second indicator is described in the specific section for each field. All content designators for the 650-658 fields are described in the specific section for each field.
** CONTENT DESIGNATOR HISTORY
   Field 600-651 - Subject added entries
   Indicator 2 - Subject heading system/thesaurus
   In 1982 the use of the second indicator value in subject added entry fields 600-651 was expanded from specifying the organization that assigned the subject added entry to specifying the subject heading system, thesaurus, or authority file used by an organization to assign the subject added entry. Accordingly, values 0-3 and 5-6 became authoritative-agency data elements and their definitions were changed to the names of the list or authority file. The definition of value 4 was changed from Other subject heading. Prior to 1975, value 5 was defined in the visual materials specifications as Subject heading to be printed only in LC book catalog. Prior to 1977, value 5 was defined in the archival and manuscripts control specifications as National Union Catalog of Manuscripts (NUCMC) subject heading.

   Field 648 - Subject Added Entry-Chronological Term [NEW, 2002]

   Field 652 - Subject Added Entry-Reversed Geographic [OBSOLETE, 1980]
   Field 652 was an agency-defined field used by the Library of Congress for reversed geographic added entries assigned to materials classed in LC classification number span G1000-G9999. For each regular Topic-Place subject heading assigned, a reversed Place--Topic heading was also assigned. Both indicator positions were undefined. The subfield codes were: $a (Geographic name or place element), $x (General subject subdivision), $y (Chronological subject subdivision), $z (Geographic subject subdivision).

   Field 662 - Subject Added Entry - Hierarchical Place Name [NEW, 2005]

   Field 680 - PRECIS Descriptor String [OBSOLETE, 1991] [CAN/MARC only]
   PRECIS Descriptor String is a sequence of subject index terms in which each term is preceded by a code which determines how it should appear in entries generated by a computer. The first indicator was undefined. The second indicator values 0-9 were used to link alternative subject statements to the corresponding Dewey classification number. Subfields $a-$z contained the text of the PRECIS Descriptor String.

   Field 681 - PRECIS Subject Indicator Number (SIN) [OBSOLETE, 1991] [CAN/MARC only]
   PRECIS Subject Indicator Number (SIN) is a fixed-length number ending in a modulus 11 check digit. It identifies uniquely the address of the PRECIS data consisting of string and Reference Indicator Number (RIN). The first indicator was undefined. The second indicator values 0-9 were used to link the indicator to the corresponding PRECIS string and other associated subject data. Only subfield $a (PRECIS subject indicator number (SIN)) was defined.

   Field 683 - PRECIS Reference Indicator Number (RIN) [OBSOLETE, 1991] [CAN/MARC only]
   PRECIS Reference Indicator Number (RIN) is a fixed-length number ending in a modulus 11 check digit which identifies the address of a term in the machine-held thesaurus used as the source of 'See' and 'See also' references in a printed index. The first indicator was undefined. The second indicator values 0-9 were used to link the index numbers to the corresponding PRECIS descriptor string. Only subfield $a (Reference indicator number (RIN)) was defined.

* 70X-75X: Added Entry Fields
** DEFINITION AND SCOPE
   Added entries that provide additional access to a bibliographic record from names and/or titles having various relationships to a work. Added entries are made for persons, corporate bodies, and meetings having some form of responsibility for the creation of the work, including intellectual and publishing responsibilities. Also included are added entries for other titles under authority control related to the work for which the record is made, such as other editions, etc. Field 740 contains a title not under authority control for a part of the item being cataloged, or a related item. Added entries are assigned to records for persons, corporate bodies, meetings, and titles which are not given access through subject or series entries. Fields 752-754 provide for access to an item through other aspects of its content or description.

   Descriptions of the first indicator and all subfield codes, as well as input conventions for the 700, 710, 711, and 730 fields are given in the following General Information sections: X00, X10, X11, and X30. The second indicator is described in the specific section for each field. All content designators for fields 720, 740-754 are described in the specific section for each field.

   Added entry fields are not used as often in bibliographic records for materials under archival control as they are for materials under other types of control. In archival control, greater use is made of the 6XX fields for access.

** DEFINITION AND SCOPE 
Information that identifies other related bibliographic items. Each of the
linking entry fields specifies a different relationship between the target item
described by the record and a related item. These relationships fall into three
classes: 1) related items that assist the user in continuing to search but are
not physically required to obtain the target item (e.g., former entries for
continuing resources, translations of the target item); 2) related items that
have to be obtained physically in order to use the target item (e.g., the host
item for a component part: a journal issue containing a specific article); 3)
related items that are constituent units of a larger whole (e.g., the
individual photographs contained in a visual material collection). The linking
entry fields are designed to generate a note in a display of the record in
which they appear. They can also provide machine linkage between the
bibliographic record for the target item and the bibliographic record for the
related item, if the related item is covered by a separate record; and/or
facilitate indexing.

** TERMS USED IN LINKING ENTRY FIELDS
Target Item - Bibliographic item that is the principal or primary unit covered
by the description for which the record was constructed. The target item is the
item to which the information in character positions 06 (Type of record) and 07
(Bibliographic level) of the Leader, and field 245 (Title Statement) apply.
Related Item - Bibliographic item that has a chronological, horizontal
(different versions), or vertical (hierarchical) relationship with a target
item, and for which the linking entry field is formulated.
Component Part - Bibliographic item that is physically part of another
bibliographic item such that the retrieval of the part is dependent on the
physical identification and location of the host item (e.g., a chapter in a
book, an article in a journal). (Field 774)
Constituent Unit - Bibliographic item that is part of another item. The
constituent unit is physically separate from the item of which it is considered
a part. (Fields 770, 774)
Host Item - Bibliographic item that either physically contains (as in the case
of the component part), or bibliographically includes (as in the case of a
constituent unit), the subpart that is the target item for the record. For
example, if a record describes a journal article, the host is the journal; if a
record describes one digital item in a set, the host is the set. (Fields 772,
773)
Chronological Relationship - Relationship in time between bibliographic items
(e.g., the relation of a serial to its predecessors and successors). (Fields
777, 780, 785)
Horizontal Relationship - Relationship between versions of a bibliographic item
in different languages, formats, media, etc. (Fields 765, 767, 775, 776)
Vertical Relationship - Hierarchical relationship of the whole to its parts and
the parts to the whole (e.g., a journal article to the journal, collective
title of conference proceedings to individual titles of contributions,
subseries to main entry series). (Fields 760, 762, 770)

** RECORD LINKS AND NOTES 
Linking Entry Fields (fields 760-787) - Fields carry descriptive data
concerning the related item, the control number for the record of the related
item, or both. Minimal content designation is provided for the data concerning
the related item that is used in the linking entry fields. For data operations
requiring fuller content designation such as indexing and sorting, subfield $w
(control number for the related item) allows the system to follow that link to
the related record to obtain fully content-designated data. Moreover, the coded
data in control subfield $7 allows some types of indexing without reference to
the actual related record. The value used in the first indicator position of a
linking entry field determines whether a note is to be generated from the
linking entry field or from field 580.
In fields 76X-78X the general resource to resource relationship is indicated by
the choice of tag with some more specific relationships indicated by indicators
in fields 772, 780, and 785. Subfield $i is used to indicate relationships not
expressed in the tag or indicator, thus is appropriate for more specific
relationship designations. If it is desirable to make the specific relationship
information available in a coded form, subfield $4 is used.
Linking Entry Complexity Note (field 580) - Linking Entry Fields are designed
to support generation of a note concerning the related item in a display of the
record for the target item. When the relationship is too complex to be
expressed using relationship information expressed by the tag indicator, or $i
or $4 subfields, and the data from the linking entry field or the linked
record, the note is recorded in the Linking Entry Complexity Note field. When
used, this field appears in addition to any relevant 760-787 linking entry
field, and no note is generated from the linking entry field.
Added Entries (fields 700-730) - When an added entry is desired for a title
used in a linking field, the added entry is recorded in the appropriate 700-730
field. Linking fields are not intended to take the place of added entries.
Likewise, an added entry in field 700-730 does not take the place of a linking
field, as it cannot cause a note to be generated or carry a record link.
Component Parts/Constituent Units - Linking entry field 773 (Host Item Entry)
is used to link the record for a component part that is an integral part of
another item to the record for the other item. For example, in records for
journal articles, it contains an identification of the journal. The exact
location of the article in the journal is recorded in subfield $g of field 773.
The record for the host item or any larger bibliographic unit may include
information about constituent units, recorded in the repeatable field 774
(Constituent Unit Entry). Information about each constituent would be recorded
in a separate occurrence of field 774.

the related record). Value 1 is used when the display constant associated with
the linking field does not adequately describe the relationship. In this case,
a note for display is recorded in field 580. The 760-787 field is recorded to
provide the machine linkage and field 580 is used for display.
Second Indicator - Display constant controller [all except 780 and 785]
Controls display constants preceding the data in linking entry fields 760-777
and 786-787. For the print constants, see the description of the second
indicator in the sections for each linking entry field.

** SUBFIELD CODES
As a general rule, each subfield defined for the linking entry fields
corresponds to a field or field block that would be used to describe the
related item in a separate record. A separate bibliographic record for the
related item may or may not exist. For example, subfield $a (Main entry
heading), corresponds to the 1XX (Main Entries) block; subfield $t (Title)
corresponds to field 245 (Title Statement), and so on. The rules and practices
applied to formulating the data in the linking entry fields are usually the
same as would be followed for formulating the data about a related item in a
separate bibliographic record except that the information provided need not be
as complete. The fullness of the bibliographic information about the related
item recorded in the linking entry fields should be based on the intended use
of the links. When the related item is represented by a separate bibliographic
record, recording only the basic bibliographic details (e.g., title, and
relationship information) is usually sufficient.
$a - Main entry heading
Main entry heading data (without the content designators) from field 100 (Main
Entry-Personal Name), 110 (Main Entry-Corporate Name), or 111 (Main Entry-
Meeting Name) in the related record. Individual components of the name or
uniform title are not recorded in a separate subfield as they would be in a 1XX
field.

$6 - Linkage
See description of this subfield in Appendix A: Control_Subfields.
$7 - Control subfield
Up to four character positions (designated 0, 1, etc.) that indicate special
characteristics of the linked entry. Because the definitions of the codes in
subfield $7 are dependent on the character position in which they occur, the
coding of any character position mandates that each preceding character
position contains a code or the fill character (|); succeeding character
positions need not be used. For example, if position 0 and 1 are not applicable
but position 2 is applicable, then position 0 and 1 contain code n (Not
applicable) or a fill character.
/0 - Type of main entry heading
Code indicating either the type of name contained in subfield $a or the uniform
title in subfield $t. The codes correspond to the 1XX tag in the record for the
related item: 100 (Main Entry-Personal Name), 110 (Main Entry-Corporate Name),
111 (Main Entry-Meeting Name), and 130 (Main Entry-Uniform Title). Code n is
used when no other codes apply.
p Personal name
c Corporate name
m Meeting name
u Uniform title
n Not applicable
/1 - Form of name
Code indicating the form of the name contained in subfield $a. The code
corresponds to the value of the first indicator in the 1XX field in the record
for the related item, and must thus be interpreted in conjunction with the
value in position 0.If position 0 = p (Personal name), position 1 contains one
of the following codes:
0 Forename
1 Surname
3 Family name
If position 0 = c (Corporate name) or m (Meeting name), position 1 contains one
of the following codes:
0 Inverted name
1 Jurisdiction name
2 Name in direct order
If position 0 = u (Uniform title) or n (Not applicable), position 1 contains:
n Not applicable

** INPUT CONVENTIONS
Establishing a link - Links are established reciprocally in related
bibliographic records. A linking entry field links to a related item which may
be represented in a file by a record. When related records exist, each record
may contain a corresponding linking entry. In some cases the reciprocal linking
entries use the same field tags, in others they have corresponding field tags.
The reciprocal field tags are as shown below:

Record                             Related_record
760 (Main Series Entry)            762 (Subseries Entry)
765 (Original Language Entry)      767 (Translation Entry)
770 (Supplement/Spec. Issue Entry) 772 (Supplement Parent Entry)
773 (Host Item Entry)              774 (Constituent Unit Entry)
775 (Other Edition)                775 (Other Edition)
776 (Additional Physical Form)     776 (Additional Physical Form)
777 (Issued With Entry)            777 (Issued With Entry)
780 (Preceding Entry)              785 (Succeeding Entry)
787 (Nonspec. Relationship Entry)  787 (Nonspec. Relationship Entry)

Definitions of the second indicator values for reciprocal fields 780 and 785
are also reciprocal as shown below:

2nd_indicator_of_780           2nd_indicator_of_785
0-Continues                    0-Continued by

------                         8-Changed back to...
Punctuation - Ends with the punctuation contained in the 1XX field of the
related record. The linking entry fields do not end in a mark of punctuation
unless an abbreviation, initial/letter, or other data that ends with a period
is present, or subfield $a is the last subfield.

** CONTENT DESIGNATOR HISTORY 
Fields 760-787 originally were defined only in the serials specifications and
contained information describing relationships between bibliographic items that
did not necessarily facilitate indexing or provide a machine link to the record
for the related item. In 1977, subfield $w (Record control number) was defined
in these fields to facilitate linkage among records within a given system and
across systems.

In 1981, the following fields were validated for the books specifications and
subfield $r was defined to permit linkage through report numbers of technical
report materials: 765, 767, 770, 772, 775, 776, 780, 785, and 787.

When the record-linking technique was fully developed in 1982, field 773 (Host
Item Entry) was defined for all MARC specifications to accommodate the
cataloging of component parts. The definitions of several other subfields were
either broadened or more narrowly defined at that time.

Field 786 - Data Source Entry [NEW, 1995]
Field 787 - Nonspecific Relationship Entry [RENAMED, 2009]

$c - Place of publication (SE) [REDEFINED, 1976]
$d - Dates of publication (SE) [OBSOLETE, 1976]
$g - Relationship dates [REDEFINED, 1982]
Subfield $g was broadened in 1982 as part of the record-linking specifications,
specifically to include the location information of a component part in a host
item.
$b - Edition [NEW, 1982]
$d - Place, publisher, and date of publication [NEW, 1982]
$g - Relationship information [RENAMED, 2009]
$i - Display text [REDEFINED, 2009]
$k - Series data for related item [NEW, 1982]
$s - Uniform title [NEW, 1982]
$q - Parallel title [OBSOLETE, 1990]
$q - Enumeration and first page [NEW, 2003]
$7 - Control subfield [NEW, 1982]
Prior to 1982, edition statements and publication statements were recorded in
subfield $c, and uniform titles were recorded in subfield $t.
$7/1 - Form of name2 - Multiple surname [OBSOLETE, 1996]
Use of the Form of name code 2 (Multiple surname) was made obsolete when code 1
(Single surname) was redefined as surname to be used for headings with either
single or multiple surnames.
$7/2 - Type of record
    $b - Archival and manuscripts control [OBSOLETE, 1995]
$7/3 - Bibliographic level from Leader/07 of related record
    p - Pamphlet [OBSOLETE] [CAN/MARC only]

$4 - Relationship code [NEW, 2009]

* 80X-83X: Series Added Entry Fields
** FIELD DEFINITION AND SCOPE
Fields 800-830 contain series added entries for series associated with a title. These fields are used to trace a series added entry when the form of series present in the 490 Series Statement field cannot serve additionally as a series added entry.

A description of the first indicator and all subfield codes, as well as input conventions for the 800, 810, 811, and 830 fields, are given in the following General Information sections: X00, X10, X11, and X30. The second indicator is described in the specific section for each field.
** CONTENT DESIGNATOR HISTORY
   Field 840 - Series Added Entry - Title [OBSOLETE, 1980]
   Field 840 was made obsolete when the decision was made to use field 830 for both uniform titles and conventional titles that are not entered under a name. For field 840, the first indicator was undefined; the second was defined for nonfiling characters (values 0-9). The subfield codes were: $a (Title), $h (Medium), $v (Volume or number).

* 841-88X: Holdings, Location, Alternate Graphics, Etc. Fields
** DEFINITION AND SCOPE
   Descriptions for data elements which are an integral part of the MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data and data elements which may appear either in bibliographic records or in separate MARC holdings records.

   Field 850 is a bibliographic record field that contains minimal holdings location data. Field 852 contains more extensive location data. Field 856 covers information about the location of electronic resources. These fields are described fully in this format. Fields 841-845, 853-855, and 863-878 are only listed here.

   Full descriptions for them appear in the MARC 21 Format for Holdings Data. The holdings format should be consulted for field descriptions and information concerning the inclusion of fields 841-845, 853-855, and 863-878 in bibliographic records.

   Fields 880, 882, 886 and 887 have special uses described in this document.
** CONTENT DESIGNATOR HISTORY
   Field 851 - Location (AM, MP, VM) [OBSOLETE, 1993]
   Both indicator positions were undefined. The subfield codes were: $a (Name (custodian or owner)), $b (Institutional division), $c (Street address), $d (Country), $e (Location of units), $f (Item number), $g (Repository location code), $3 (Materials specified), $6 (Linkage). Location information may be contained in holdings/bibliographic field 852 (Location). 

   Field 870 - Variant Personal Name (BK, AM, MP, MU, VM, SE) [OBSOLETE, 1987]

   Field 871 - Variant Corporate Name (BK, AM, MP, MU, VM, SE) [OBSOLETE, 1987]

   Field 872 - Variant Conference or Meeting Name (BK, AM, MP, MU, VM, SE) [OBSOLETE, 1987]

   Field 873 - Variant Uniform Title Heading (BK, AM, MP, MU, VM, SE) [OBSOLETE, 1987]

   Fields 870, 871, 872, and 873 were defined for the serials specifications in 1979. The subfield codes were the same as the corresponding heading field, with the addition of subfield $j (Tag and sequence number of the field for which the 87X field is a variant). The first indicator in each field was the same as in the corresponding 1XX, 4XX, 6XX, 7XX, or 8XX heading field. The second indicator specified the form of heading: Indicator 2 - Form of heading
   0 - ALA form, as authenticated by LC
   1 - AACR 1 form, as authenticated by LC
   2 - ALA form, not yet authenticated by LC
   3 - AACR 1 form, not yet authenticated by LC
